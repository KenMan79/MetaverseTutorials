Explanation
How metaverse wallets work
transactions, transaction fee, utxo, mnemonics, ETP

ETP is the native currency of the Metaverse blockchain. To send and receive ETP you need a Metaverse wallet.

Key concepts in this tutorial:

ETP uses Bitcoins UTXO based model. This means....

Every time you receive a transaction, it becomes a UTXO.
Every time you send a transaction, you collect UTXO's into a transaction input,
which becomes a UTXO on the receivers end, and the change left over becomes a UTXO on your end.

Don't worry. Metaverse's library manages UTXO's for you
